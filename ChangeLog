2011.0b1	Sun Jan 15 2011 
	* First beta of new major release.

Important Changes beside Linebreak 1.x:

	* 1.x has memory leaks & potantial buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
	  Switching to release 20XX is strongly recommended.
	* Renamed package name from Linebreak to Sombok.
	* Major changes on public interface:
	- urgent_func callback takes two arguments, not five.
	- sizing_func callback with extra 6th argument was obsoleted.
	- default sizing method simply returns number of grapheme
	  clusters, not number of columns based on UAX #11.  For
	  compatible behavior with 1.x, use linebreak_sizing_UAX11()
	  built-in callback function.
	- linebreak_break*() functions return array of lines, not
	  single Unicode string.  Additinally, elements of array are
	  grapheme cluster strings.
